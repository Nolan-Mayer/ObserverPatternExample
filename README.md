# ObserverPatternExample
//Nolan Mayer//

This repository demonstrates the use of an observer pattern.
This repository was partially written by the professor and my job was to implement a series of concrete classes and interfaces that utilize the observer pattern (a one-to-many dependency between objects)
This was written in JAVA, IDE Replit.
